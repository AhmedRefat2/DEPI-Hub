# DEPI-Hub
DEPI HUB is a simple web platform to showcase the projects of DEPI trainees. It allows trainees to upload their projects, organize them by category (Web, AI, Mobile, etc.), and build personal profiles. Companies and trainers can explore projects, search by technology or trainee, and connect with talents easily.
